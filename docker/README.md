Docker Instructions

Hey 1301313Y I am working on this project as well if you dont mind, I will make merge requests shortly.

I have fixed a loooot of stuff over the past 3-5 days I just need to push it to my fork and submit merges.

I will work on Docker / Docker instructions after I finish my changes to the webpages.

You should probably enable the "Issues" tracker... Sorry for merge request, no other way to contact you.

I will help tackle some of the issues.
