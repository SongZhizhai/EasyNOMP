## Helping give NOMP new life! With some style.
#### If you want to help contribute, please look at the original [project](https://github.com/foxer666/node-open-mining-portal) first!

BootNOMP is all the things great about NOMP, now with modern style and design of BootStrap 4! Having disliked the previous UI, due to cramping, little to no info displayed while what is displayed is not very helpful to users. I decided to fork a already great project, and add some stylistic touches it severely needs. I would of considered requesting pulls to the main branch, though with such heavy changes to the project, I decided a hard fork would be well suited. But if you would like to contribute, please consider looking at the [original project](https://github.com/foxer666/node-open-mining-portal) first, as these guys are the ones who helped get this NOMP rebirthing process started.

### Node Open Mining Portal consists from 3 main modules:
* [NOMP](https://github.com/1301313Y/node-open-mining-portal)
* [Stratum Pool](https://github.com/1301313Y/node-stratum-pool)
* [Node Multihashing](https://github.com/1301313Y/node-multi-hashing)

_Stratum Pool can be replaced with [node-merged-pool](https://github.com/UNOMP/node-merged-pool)._<br>
_Add new algorithms using [Node Multihashing](https://github.com/1301313Y/node-multi-hashing)._

Current version: v1.1.2

-------
### Install
```
git clone https://github.com/foxer666/node-open-mining-portal.git pool
cd pool
npm install
node init.js
```
-------
### Requirements
* Node 8.x.x or higher
* Coin daemon
* Redis Server

### Run in Docker
_I Do Not Use Docker, So I Will Not Be Maintaining This Feature_
1) Correct configs appropriately to your environment in docker directory
2) ```cd docker```
3) ```docker build -t nomp .```
4) ```docker run -d --name nomp -v $(pwd)/config:/opt/config nomp ```

You will need to expose some ports to make it accessible from outside. You can achieve this by adding option -p HOST_PORT:CONTAINER_PORT in 4th step

You can see the logs of the server with ```docker logs -f nomp```, or jump into container with ```docker exec -it nomp```.

### Hashing algorithms
#### Working
|   | Algorithm | Comment|
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| ✓ | __Groestl__ | tested only shares with AuroraCoin, blocks not tested |
| ✓ | __lyra2z__ | Working in testnet *mining* and *payouts* |
| ✓ | __Scrypt__ | tested with AntiLiteCoin, 1CREDIT, ArgusCoin, WAYAWOLFCOIN and many others |
| ✓ | __SHA256__ | tested with VCOIN, don't use with BTC, no Segwit tested |
| ✓ | __X11__ | tested with BrainCoin, CannabisCoin, AdzCoin and many others |
| ✓ | __C11__ | tested shares and payments with Dixicoin |
| ✓ | __X16r__ | tested with RavenCoin |
| ✓ | __Qubit__ | Shares works, and blocks should now too. |
| ✓ | __NeoScrypt__ | working now thanks to @foxer666 pushing update to parent repo |
| ✓ | __Yescrypt__ | needs tests, though should work |
| ✓ | __YescryptR16__ | needs tests, though should work |
| ✓ | __YescryptR32__ | currently being tested with WaviCoin. shares work, payments unconfirmed |

### Notes
#### Lyra2Z
If you are going to test ZCoin (lyra2z) on testnet, make sure you are uncommented proper lines in transactions.js in https://github.com/foxer666/node-stratum-pool 

There is a ```payment-fixes``` branch where i fixed previous blockHash problem and corrected payouts. Check it out in this and stratum server module.
